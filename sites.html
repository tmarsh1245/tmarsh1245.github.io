            As you'll see below I've worked on several other projects before but this... this is my baby. It took a few tries to find what I liked, but with enough of my colors, pictures, and personality, I think
                its finally come to life. To many more!

            <h4>My first solo website...</h4>
            <p>The owner of Turnpike Auto Repair, a family friend, came to me saying he was finally ready to invest in a web presence. I leaped at
                the opportunity, especially as it was my first time being paid for web design. And while it allowed me to practice my skills further,
                the real benefit came from working one on one with a client for the first time. It was interesting to have my priorities be someone else's
                specifications but through early and frequent feedback we ended up with a product he was happy with.

            <h4>The ways of the web...</h4>
            <p>After hanging with my cousin Allie this past Christmas I agreed to do her website's search engine optimization for her.
                It's a Squarespace site and was pretty before I stepped in, but I immediately picked it apart finding issue after issue.
                I stepped up, going from SEO consultant to full developer working to make her lovely photos easy to navigate and optimized all while
                keeping her personality fully ingrained. And through hours spent adding alt text, writing meta tags, and changing image names, I learned
                much about how search engines rank sites. I hope to do more family projects in the future.

            <h4>To where it began...</h4>
            <p>Interning at East Coast Divers was not what I expected it to be, my days could be spent doing anything from making sales to new customers
                to learning amateur carpentry building the deck out back. After troubleshooting ECD's current website, finding numerous content errors, visual bugs, and broken links,
                the owners finally saw my potential as a new web developer. Instead of being asked to drive to the shop each day, the head developer and I separated to begin
                design on a new website. It's on hold for now but I would love to return to it one day.
