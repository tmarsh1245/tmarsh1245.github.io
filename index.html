                    Welcome! If you're here you have probably followed a link sent by myself or found through LinkedIn or other source. I created this website from scratch using Bulma for styling, HTML, and hosting through GitHub. I've realized I quite enjoy the aesthetic side of coding as its a creative break from my mainly logical based activities and allows me to strike a nice balance of thinking. It's one of my strengths to balanced, whether between creative and logical thinking, being a tech person and a people person, and being structured yet flexible.

                    If you're an employer looking for a well balanced team player to join your team, let me tell you, I'm your guy. Currently interested in a summer internship, I am actively applying and now would be an ideal time to contact me. What is important in a company for me is an environment conducive to self improvement preferably operating with Agile methodologies. You'll find I am extremely loyal and self motivated, but even more so when I enjoy where I am working.
            </h2>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                    This website acts as somewhat of an extra resume, but I'd like it to be more intimate than that. While you check my academic record or professional experience, please also consider browsing my interests and taking in who I really am. After all, you should get to know your future employee. Enjoy!
